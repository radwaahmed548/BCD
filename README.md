# BREAST CANCER DETECTION
This application is about offering women a way to remind them to self-examine
each month and for cancer patients to detect the type of cancer and help them to
plan their new journey against this disease. As an application, it requires
registration from users. Users can either choose to see a video of the self-
examination or go to the prediction tab and enter their test results to determine
the type of tumor. Also, users can provide their feedback or ask any questions.
Also, they can share stories and see other people’s stories.

## Abstract
Now days, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed life-threatening
cancer in women and the leading cause of cancer death among women. In 2020,
there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 685 000 deaths
globally. Unfortunately, it’s very common so our project aims to help women
by either reminding them to their monthly self-examination for early detection
or helping women who already has suspicions about having cancer by detecting
the result of their test and making their journey with treatments and dealing with
cancer a little bit easier .

## Overview
- This application reminds the user to her self-examination every month.
- It can predict whether the tumor is benign or malignant based on blood
test results.
- It can help the user to set-up a calendar to remind her with her doctor
appointments, chemotherapy sessions and her medications.
- It offers community support where other users can share their stories
about their journey and how.

## documentation
The main target of this Document is to describe our solution in dealing with
breast cancer that we will develop. The documentation gives a detailed
description of the both functional and non-functional requirements in details and
describes the hardware and software interface requirements.

## Objectives
- Save time: by entering your test results the application can
predict if your tumor is benign or malignant.
- Raise Awareness: Most women forget to do their monthly
check-ups even though they can be lifesaving as detecting if
there is a tumor early can help with treatment and increase
chances of healing.
- Support Patients: Having cancer have its own mental effects as
well as physical, knowing that someone is going through the
same thing as you can help patients and reading other people’s
survival stories can inspire them and give them hope.

## What materials and equipment does the project need?
Hardware: A high functioning smartphone with Wi-Fi is all that is needed.
Software:
- Operating system: Android or IOS.
- Programming language: Dart.
- Database: Firebase.
- Python.
